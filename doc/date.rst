The Date Extension
==================

The ``date`` extension provides the following filters:

* ``datediff``: The date filter is able to format a interval between a date and today:
  
   The post was sent {{ post.published_at | datediff }} ago.

   {# Returns 'The post was sent 5 days and 1 hour ago' #}


Configuration
-------------

This filter uses the traslator service so, you need to activate it:

   // app/config/config.yml
   framework:
       translator:      { fallback: en }

After that, you need to register the extension:

  // app/config/config.yml
  services:
    twig.extension.date:
      class: Twig_Extensions_Extension_Date
      tags:
        - { name: twig.extension }
      arguments: [ @translator ]

Usage
_____

    {{ [datetime instance or string] | datediff }}

You can also specify the timezone, the message catalog and the locale

    {{ [datetime instance or string] | datediff("Europe/Madrid")  }}
    {{ [datetime instance or string] | datediff("Europe/Madrid", "admin")  }}

By default, the message catalog is "TwigExtensionsDate". There are some translations on
vendor/twig-extensions/lib/Resources/translations/ You have to copy this files to your bundle
on src/Your/Bundle/Resources/translations/
