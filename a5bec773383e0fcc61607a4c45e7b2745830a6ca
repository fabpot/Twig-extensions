I know that most people think that this filter belongs to JavaScript because of its dynamic nature. However, in some backend applications is common to display these fuzzy dates in listings. Using JavaScript in those cases makes no sense because you don't need the dates to be continuously updated.

However, I don't like the proposed `time_diff` name because it's a bit misleading (that name would be perfect for a filter that just simply computes differences between two date times). If this PR is accepted, could we change its name for the more common `time_ago`?

The extension is now using the core twig_date_converter function as mentioned by @fabpot.

Can you also add some unit tests for this new feature?

I've added unit tests and some usage notes to the documentation.

I've updated the docs according to your comments @fabpot. I didn't quite understand what you meant with `, not.
